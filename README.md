# Neuron
A perceptron is a fundamental building block of artificial neural networks, functioning as a binary classifier. It takes multiple inputs, each with an associated weight, and produces a single output based on a threshold. Essentially, it's a simple model of a biological neuron, designed to mimic how neurons communicate and learn.
